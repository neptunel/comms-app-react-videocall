## How to run the Video Conferencing app

Run the following steps after cloning the repository to run the application locally.

### Install dependencies

**note** : This guide is written with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) in mind.

Open a terminal window in the root directory of your project folder. Install the project's dependencies using the following command.

```bash
yarn
```

### Paste the token

Open file [src/App.tsx](./src/App.tsx), find line 18 and replace `{YOUR_TOKEN}` with your access token string, prepared previously in [this step](#how-to-obtain-access-token). It should look like this:

```javascript
  return (
    <TranslationProvider>
      <ConferenceCreateProvider>
        <CommsProvider token="bGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJOTQxMywic3V...23r2fsdvsdfsfdsvfd">
          <...>
        </CommsProvider>
      </ConferenceCreateProvider>
    </TranslationProvider>
  );
```

### Start the app

Execute the following command to run the application locally.

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Open the app in a browser

After the appropriate message appears in the terminal window, open <http://localhost:3000> in the browser. The application will launch at this address.

## How to build the Video Conferencing app
